# Banking Agents connectivity

Interactive web map to visualize mobile network coverage (Unitel & Africell, via nPerf tiles) and planned Banking Agent locations across Angola.

Built with [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/), the tool allows toggling between operator coverage layers (3G, 4G (LTE) and 5G) and overlaying CSV files with agent coordinates.

## Features

- Toggle Unitel and Africell 3G, 4G(LTE) and 5G coverage layers (nPerf).

- Adjustable coverage opacity for easier visualization.

- Load CSV of Banking Agents (columns: latitude, longitude, nome).

- Works entirely client-side â€” no server dependency, just open in browser.

- Deployable via GitHub Pages for demos & reports.
